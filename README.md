# Week 8 Assignment: Menu App

This repository contains my submission for the Week 8 assignment: a JavaScript menu app that demonstrates the use of classes, arrays, and user interaction, as outlined in the assignment instructions.

## Assignment Instructions

- Write code in Visual Studio Code that accomplishes the objectives below.
- Comment your code to demonstrate understanding (**required**).
- Create a new GitHub repository and push your code.
- Record and upload a video showcasing your assignment.
- Keep track of the URLs for your GitHub repository and video upload.
- Start the Quiz to submit your assignment.
- Submit the URLs for your GitHub repo and video in the Quiz.
- Answer the quiz questions.

## Coding Requirements

Your menu app must:

- Use **at least one array** to store data.
- Use **at least two classes** (for example, one for menu items and another for the menu itself).
- Provide options to **create**, **view**, and **delete** elements in the menu.

You are free to choose the theme of your app (e.g., restaurant menu, to-do list, library, etc.), as long as it meets the requirements above.
